## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
To collect, store, and analyze historical and real-time air quality data using MongoDB and basic data science tools. The goal is to explore pollution trends and demonstrate a basic MapReduce-style analysis.

## ðŸ—‚ Planned Structure
- Use data from Kaggle and OpenWeatherMap API
- Store all data in MongoDB (NoSQL)
- Process and visualize data in Jupyter using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Perform MapReduce-like calculations via MongoDB aggregation
